![Train Scheduler](https://github.com/pamelatholan/Firebase-Train-Scheduler/blob/master/assets/images/Train.PNG)

* Create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.
* The website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
* The app uses Moment.js to retrieve and manipulate the times.

* Basic Inclusions
    * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
        * Train Name
        * Destination 
        * First Train Time -- in military time
        * Frequency -- in minutes
    * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
    * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
    * Styling and theme.

* I also added a button so trains could be deleted.
